![App Page Screenshots](images)

A project that aims to clone the functionality of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), utilizing React and JavaScript for the frontend, and server.js for the backend.

## Features

- Simulates the behavior of GPT, a powerful language model.
- Provides an intuitive and interactive user interface.
- Implements backend server.js for handling user requests.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 API credentials. (Refer to OpenAI's documentation for obtaining API credentials.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/satyam3196/GPT-Clone

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd gpt-clone

3. Install the frontend and backend dependencies:
npm install
cd client
npm install
cd ..
This will install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend components of the project.


### Configuration

1. Obtain OpenAI GPT-3.5 API credentials.
- Follow the instructions provided by OpenAI to sign up and obtain the API credentials.

2. Configure API credentials:
- In the root directory of the project, create a `.env` file.
- Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
  ```

### Usage

1. Start the frontend development server:
npm run start:frontend

2. Start the backend server:
npm run start:backend

3. Open your web browser and visit:
http://localhost:8000

Make sure to update the commands (`npm run start:frontend` and `npm run start:backend`) based on your specific setup. The first command starts the frontend development server, while the second command starts the backend server.

Feel free to modify the instructions according to your project's requirements or if you have any additional steps for running the frontend or backend components.
